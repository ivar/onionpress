"""Every external input to the container images is pinned and verified.

Before this, none of the 17 external inputs across the three Dockerfiles was
pinned: `FROM rust:latest`, `cargo install arti` with no --version,
`MKP224O_COMMIT=master`, `FROM wordpress:latest`, `COPY --from=docker:cli`,
and an unverified wp-cli.phar from a gh-pages branch. Two builds of the same
commit could ship a different compiler, a different arti and a different
mkp224o — and because CI builds amd64 and arm64 on separate runners at
different times, the two halves of one published manifest could disagree.

Since Onimages 0.3.0 (2026-09-24) the tor image is built ON the Tor Project's
own C Tor image from containers.torproject.org. The apt-key verification this
file used to check therefore happens in the Tor Project's build, not ours;
what this file asserts instead is that the base is that image, pinned by
digest. Arti was removed the same day (no control interface for onion
services); the image must not grow it back by accident.

One input is pinned by compiler flag rather than by version: mkp224o's
configure.ac appends `-march=native`, so pinning its commit still left the
binary varying with the builder's CPU — and a binary built on a newer CI host
SIGILLs on an older user CPU, which nothing above it treats as fatal: the site
just carries on with a random address.

These are static checks on the Dockerfiles. They cannot prove an image builds;
they prove the inputs are named immutably and that the build-time assertions
(mkp224o commit, mkp224o CFLAGS, wp-cli checksum) are still wired.
