"""Every external input to the container images is pinned and verified.

Before this, none of the 17 external inputs across the three Dockerfiles was
pinned: `FROM rust:latest`, `cargo install arti` with no --version,
`MKP224O_COMMIT=master`, `FROM wordpress:latest`, `COPY --from=docker:cli`,
and an unverified wp-cli.phar from a gh-pages branch. Two builds of the same
commit could ship a different compiler, a different arti and a different
mkp224o — and because CI builds amd64 and arm64 on separate runners at
different times, the two halves of one published manifest could disagree.

Since Onimages 0.3.0 (2026-09-24) the tor image is built ON the Tor Project's
own onion-service images from containers.torproject.org: their C Tor image is
the runtime base and their arti image supplies the arti binary. The apt-key
verification this file used to check therefore happens in the Tor Project's
build, not ours; what this image asserts instead is that both images are
pinned by digest and that the arti they deliver is the version and feature set
the app needs.

These are static checks on the Dockerfiles. They cannot prove an image builds;
they prove the inputs are named immutably and that the build-time assertions
(arti version and onion-service feature, mkp224o commit, wp-cli checksum) are
still wired.
